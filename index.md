# Hello!

Welcome to my website, I don't have very much stuff on here but feel free to try out some of my greatest creations that I hope you enjoy.

## About

If you haven't noticed already, I am not the greatest programmer, but I do enjoy programming. I fork GitHub repos and other open-source projects and customise them and make them better. If you have a good eye, you would also have noticed this is one of the demo Jeykll themes you can get with GitHub Pages.

## Obama 2048

**Obama 2048** is something I made in a very short amount of time, the goal was to create a Barack Obama themed 2048 game and make it look as ugly as possible (which is hard when Obama's face is all over it)

You can check it out below and I hope you enjoy what I have made.

(I am not very good at the game :P)



This is everything I have on my bootiful website, for now...
